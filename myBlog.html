                    <h3>A step into the unknown: Day 1</h3>
                    <p><em>19th May 2022</em></p>

                        <p>Today is the first day of my journey into building a technology business in the golf industry.</p>
                        
                        <p>Yesterday was my final day working for Accenture as a management consultant having been in the industry for 8.5 years with KPMG, BCS Consulting and briefly Accenture.</p>

                        <p>In that time I have worked with excellent people from start to finish, and learnt alot about myself and the financial services space. Whilst the challenges of the job were
                         engaging, the subject matter itself never aligned with my personal interests.</p>
                         
                         <p>In that very 'millennial of ways' I have decided to reset the career clock, and shoot for 
                         something a more aligned with the things I <em>choose</em> to read about, and spend my free time doing.</p>

                        <p>My interests have always been fairly straight forward. I love all sports - football, tennis, squash, rugby, skiing etc. but the one that really gripped me was golf. </p>
                        
                        <p>I started playing regularly when I was 17 and have been hooked ever since. So when considering what kind of industry I wanted to build a career in, I decided to start with golf.</p>

                        <p>Playing golf professionally starting at 32 would be virtually impossible, so I knew I would have to look on the edges of the game for a career path. After considering a
                         few different options I decided that trying to build a business in the golf industry would give me the mental stimulation I need, whilst allowing me to focus on a
                          topic that fascinates me.</p>

                        <p>As a golfer who loves to play new courses, I feel like I have identified some issues with the way golf information is presented on the internet. 
                            As a result I decided it might be a good idea to provide a website that would provide better information to golfers. 
                            One slight problem with that plan is that I literally have <strong>zero</strong> coding experience or computer science background. </p>

                        <p>After doing a bit of research into the 'indie maker' space and reading and listening to a dutch guy called Pieter Levels (founder of NomadList) has conviced
                         me that it is possible to learn to code; albeit probably very difficult and challenging. However, having the product I want to build in mind, gives me a very tangible 
                         challenge in which to learn the technical side of web development.</p>

                         <p>So why not just hire a developer to do it for me? Well I have no indication other than my own instinct, that the market wants my product and I'm not going to spend all my savings
                            finding out...</p>

                        <p>When my risk averse instincts kick in, I remind myself that knowledge of computer science and coding is now almost a pre-requisite to land most jobs in the lucrative big-tech
                         industry. So even if my own plan turns out to be a disaster, a year of learning to code is likely to add more to my CV than another year working in the risk function of a big
                          bank. That's what I tell myself anyway when I feel that 'no income anxiety'...</p>

                        <p>During my farewell conversations with colleagues and clients alike it struck me that so many people had considered leaving their career to follow a passion, or even to learn 
                        to code. So I thought it might be worthwhile writing this blog regularly as I go through the process, just in case my experience becomes useful for someone else at the same
                         crossroads I found myself in at some time down the line.</p>

                        <p>That's enough for blog one, I have not even worked out how to get people to subscribe to this blog via email on a no code website builder, so please pray for me!</p>
                        
                        <p>All the best,</p>

                        <p>Michael</p>
