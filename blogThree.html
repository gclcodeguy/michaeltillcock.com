                    <h3>The first 250 days of learning to code and becoming an Indie Hacker / software entrepreneur: Day 251</h3>
                        <p><em>19th May 2022</em></p>
                        
                                <p>Well I've done a terrible job of writing this blog regularly so let's catch you up on the last 250 days.</p>

                        <h3><b>Quitting my job - May 2022:</b></h3>

                                <p>My last day at BCS Consulting / Accenture happened to coincide with the BCS Ball, which was essentially a black tie celebration (or commiseration) recognising the 
                                    end of BCS Consulting as a separate entity, having been acquired by big consulting beast Accenture.</p>

                                <p>It was quite a strange way to go out. Normally you might expect a leaving do in some city pub or bar with your hardcore colleague friends who have 
                                    braved the real world to say a final farewell. In this case, I had pretty much the entire company in one room which was great.</p>

                                <p>It showcased the best of what BCS was, which was a community minded firm, one where you could make real friends who made work social events fun, 
                                    rather than an obligation. It certainly shoved right in my face what I would be leaving behind.</p>

                                <p>I then had a short break spending many days on the golf course back in Nottinghamshire, before zooming off to one of my best friend's weddings in 
                                    a French chateau, which was a nice way to begin my 'sabbatical / mid-life crisis / journey into software entrepreneurship'.</p>
                        
                        <h3><b>Deciding how to start - June 2022:</b></h3>
                                <p>As I mentioned in my first blog, my principal ambition with this career break, was to launch a golf related software as a service (SaaS) business.</p>

                                <p>At this point, I had already built a fairly detailed database (&#8230;well Excel spreadsheet) of golf course information. So all I would need to
                                    do is learn how to code enough to put a really simple version of that live on the internet. In my head the only key features it needed were:</p>

                                <ul> 
                                   <li>Table of data;</li>  
                                   <li>Pagination (because it's a big table of data);</li>
                                   <li>The ability for users to add data (I now know this to be referred to as CRUD); and</li>
                                   <li>Ideally some permission controls to avoid spammers.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p> How hard could that be?</p>
                                
                                <p>Well, I already knew I could do most of that in a Google Sheet in few days. In fact, <a href="https://nomadlist.com/faq" class="inBlogLinks">NomadList</a>, which is a website containing 
                                information useful to so called digital nomads, grew out from a simple Google Sheet. NomadList was created by a legendary Indie Hacker (read independent
                                programmer entrepreneur guy) called <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/" class="inBlogLinks">Pieter Levels</a>. And I had read enough about entrepreneurship (Lean Start-up) to know the general consensus is to 
                                get a basic product (MVP) live as quickly as possible in order to see if anyone actually want to use it!</p>

                                <p>I did a bit of research into the path of least resistance for this type of site with an MVP in mind. This led me across nocode options like <a href="https://www.sheet2site.com/" class="inBlogLinks">sheets2site</a>
                                    and a very cool API for creating CRUD tables called DataTables and an extension of that <a href="https://cloudtables.com/" class="inBlogLinks">CloudTables</a>.</p>

                                <p>I decided in the end that sheet2site didn't meet my minimum feature requirements, because of the permissions element; but CloudTables was a really good
                                    option to go on with. At this point, I could have decided to put up a nocode website solution (e.g. WebFlow, Wordpress etc.) and work out how to embed 
                                    my CloudTables within that but I felt that:</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>It wouldn&rsquo;t actually be that quick because I would have to learn Webflow and CloudTables;</li>       
                                    <li>If I did get any traction, I knew it wouldn't scale in the way I envisaged - so I would have to start again; and  </li>
                                    <li>I wanted to learn to code myself, because I see it as a skillset that gives a person massive freedom, in terms of careers, location, 
                                        earning potential, entrepreneurship etc.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>So I decided to park the nocode MVP (queue successful SaaS entrepreneurs throwing their hard drives at me) and actually learn to code.</p>

                        <h3><b>First Contact with Coding - June 2022:</b></h3>

                                <p>Having done some online research about how to learn to code, I got started on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" class="inBlogLinks">freeCodeCamp's</a> (FCC) responsive web design course , which is basically
                                    learning how to code what the front end (bit you can see) of a website looks like in HTML and CSS.</p>

                                <p>Me and FCC hit it off straight away. I could not believe such an incredible learning resource was available for free, for anyone on the internet. I
                                    ploughed through the course over about a month. Alongside this I was continuing to grow my golf TikTok page and also play golf whenever a good
                                    opportunity arose. By the end of that month I knew a few things:</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>I liked coding (phew)!;</li>
                                    <li>I didn't feel I was terrible at it, it generally made logical sense; and</li>
                                    <li>I felt like I was on the right path.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>I then quickly moved onto the JavaScript coding course with FCC.</p>

                                <p>Now this was a different experience entirely. The first course, was what I would call project based. You would get a preview of what you were going 
                                    to make appear
                                    on screen, and then you would be guided through the code needed to get there. It was simple, and gave regular accomplishment related
                                    dopamine hits as you went through.</p>

                                <p>The JavaScript course was very different it started with a module with 120ish sub-tasks which were very much like reading a textbook but on screen.
                                    It felt slow, unrewarding and I wasn't sure I was learning anything! Spirits were down. In fact I was so demoralised that I had a minor PANIC!</p>

                                <p>Was I doing right thing? Why had I given up a well-paid job? I'm going to fail! All the good stuff, basically. This one JavaScript course debacle
                                    had really knocked me off course.</p>

                    <h3><b>Accidental Sabbatical: July - October 2022:</b></h3>

                                <p>As my coding progress ground to a halt, my social calendar really picked up the slack (not the chat app), including:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Starting a golf related podcast</li>
                                    <li>A bucket list trip to watch the Open at St Andrews and playing some of the best courses in Scotland, 
                                        Carnoustie, Kingsbarns and Trump Aberdeen to name a few</li>
                                    <li>My British Open golf TikTok videos being featured on Golf Digest and Zire Golf's Instagram channels</li>
                                    <li>My LIV golf TikTok videos going viral</li> 
                                    <li>My beginner golf series of videos going semi-viral</li>
                                    <li>My stag do and several other really good mates' stag dos and weddings</li>
                                    <li>My own wedding and honeymoon in October</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Amongst all this fun, there definitely was a sense of guilt and anxiety over me not progressing on my ambitions. At first it really bothered me.
                                    Then I decided to accept that I had worked my tail off for 8.5 years in the corporate world, and taking it a bit easy for a few months during 
                                    the summer was not the end of the world. I needed to think and manage my progress with a medium term mindset.</p>

                                <p>In hindsight, I am so glad I had that bit of separation. I feel it allowed me to do a mental reset and when I came back to coding full 
                                    time in late October after my honeymoon I felt like a new man.</p>

                    <h3><b>Starting the bootcamp: November 2022 - January 2023:</b></h3>

                                <p>After falling out of love with FCC, I felt I needed a new method of learning.</p>

                                <p>Initially I just tried to go back to building my website, and looking up everything I needed to know conceptually, as and when I needed to know it. 
                                    This is what Pieter Levels recommends.</p>

                                <p>This worked to a point, and certainly worked for the front end, especially when I discovered Tailwind UI 
                                    and the ability to cheaply (less than £50) buy ready-made front end code, which I could adapt to my own needs. However, I found whenever I needed to 
                                    do anything beyond basic front end coding I just did not understand the fundamentals of actual programming, to know what was going on. An example for,
                                    any coders reading this, I literally didn't know what a variable was, I was that basic. After tutorial / Google purgatory, and getting semi-abused on
                                    the prickly forum that is Stack Overflow I realised I need to learn a 'real' programming language, either JavaScript or Python.</p>

                                <p>As luck would have it, a golf friend of mine had recently applied to a coding course provided by Hyperion Dev, and funded in full (£7k) 
                                    by the UK government. With this in mind, one night I was coming back home on the London Underground and spotted an advertisement for that very 
                                    course on the tube. I decided to apply that evening. It required some fairly basic coding tasks and a bit of CV type information. A week later I
                                    had my application accepted and more by luck than by judgement I had landed on this course for free. Apparently 12k people had applied for the
                                    few hundred spots, which gave me a much needed confidence boost to keep going.</p>

                                <p>My course was on full stack Web Development on the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. In theory if I learnt all this I would be able to develop
                                    complex websites; exactly what I needed to learn to launch golfclublist.</p>

                                <p>And of course, what was the first item on the syllabus? <em>JavaScript</em>.</p>

                                <p>This time, I found the course materials and task based approach much more consumable and learnable and began to fly-through the course, trying
                                    to keep in the top 20 on the leaderboard as I went along.</p>

                    <h3><b>Where am I now? January 2023</b></h3>

                                <p>As I write this I have just completed a task to build a fairly basic React front end website for a clothing store.</p>

                                <p>I can actually use JavaScript to make stuff happen on my websites and I look forward to learning more about backend development and databases 
                                    with Node and Mongo as I finish the course. As a bit of a time capsule comment, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" class="inBlogLinks">Chat GPT</a> has just been 
                                    released which is likely a game changer
                                    for the world, but certainly in software development and learning to code, its' a bit like having a personal tutor on your desktop.</p>

                                <p>By the time I finish the course in the next month or so, I should have enough knowledge to go full steam ahead with getting golfclublist live. And 
                                    in that sense I happy that my ambition from day 1 remains the same and I just wish I had started coding 10 years ago!</p>

                                <h3><b>My key takeaways over the last 250 days are:</b></h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Start with learning HTML and CSS to get some early momentum but know that this is the easy bit </li> 
                                        <li>Quickly move onto learning JavaScript - it powers much of the web and is a full stack language (i.e. you can do everything with it to some extent)</li>
                                        <li>If you're going to do a bootcamp - I recommend doing some free online coding first to get familiar with the basics of writing code</li>  
                                        <li>I recommend writing some code in an IDE (which is the thing where you write code), rather than just on the IDE's provided by resources like CC.</li> 
                                        The best one by consensus seems to be Microsoft Visual Studio Code</li>  
                                        <li>Moving files into different folders when your coding, often breaks your code</li>  
                                        <li>Sometime coding stuff just doesn't work and you can't work it out, I have found re-writing the code sometimes fixes bugs you haven't been able to spot.</li>  
                                        <li>I am surprised by how much I have loved the actual craft of coding. I thought it was more of a tool, or means to an end, to get golfclublist live - 
                                            but it's reassuring knowing I enjoy coding, just in case golfclublist itself flops.</li>  
                                        <li>If you don't have a job - figure out a structure / schedule and stick to it - be your own boss!</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <p>I really do wonder where I will be in another 250 days?! Hopefully my next blog won't take that long to be produced!</p>

                                <p>All the best, Michael</p>
